**resmush** is a **R** package that allow users to optimize and compress images
using [reSmush.it](https://resmush.it/). reSmush.it is a free API that provides
image optimization, and it has been implemented on Wordpress, Drupal or Magento.

Some of the features of reSmush.it are:

-   Free optimization services, no API key required.
-   Optimize local and online images.
-   Image files supported: `png`, `jpg`, `gif`, `bmp`, `tif`.
-   Max image size: 5 Mb.
-   Compression via several algorithms:
    -   [**PNGQuant**](https://pngquant.org/): Strip unneeded chunks from
        `png`s, preserving a full alpha transparency.
    -   [**JPEGOptim**](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim)**:** Lossless
        optimization based on optimizing the Huffman tables.
    -   [**OptiPNG**](https://optipng.sourceforge.net/): `png` reducer that is
        used by several online optimizers.

## Example

Compressing an online `jpg` image:


```r
library(resmush)

url <- paste0(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dieghernan/",
  "resmush/main/img/jpg_example_original.jpg"
)

resmush_url(url, outfile = "jpg_example_compress.jpg")
```

::: figure
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dieghernan/resmush/main/img/jpg_example_original.jpg" alt="Original online figure" width="49%"/>

<img src="./jpg_example_compress.jpg" alt="Optimized figure" width="49%"/>

<p class="caption">

Original picture (left) 178.7 Kb and optimized picture (right) 45 Kb
(Compression 74.8%)

</p>
:::

The quality of the compression can be adjusted in the case of `jpg` files using
the parameter `qlty`. However, it is recommended to keep this value above 90 to
get a good image quality.


```r
resmush_url(url,
  outfile = "jpg_example_low.jpg", qlty = 10,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

::: figure
![Low quality figure](jpg_example_low.jpg){width="100%"}

<p class="caption">

Low quality image due to a high compression rate.

</p>
:::

All the functions return invisibly a data set with a summary of the process. The
next example shows how when compressing a local file.


```r
tmpfile <- tempfile(fileext = ".png")
url2 <- paste0(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dieghernan/",
  "resmush/main/img/png_example_original.png"
)

download.file(url2, tmpfile, quiet = TRUE)

summary <- resmush_file(tmpfile)

tibble::as_tibble(summary[, -c(1, 2)])
#> # A tibble: 1 Ã— 4
#>   src_size dest_size compress_ratio notes
#>   <chr>    <chr>     <chr>          <chr>
#> 1 186.2 Kb 70.8 Kb   62.0%          OK ;)
```

- [**xfun**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=xfun) package by Yihui
  Xie [![Sponsor Yihui Xie on
  GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sponsor-white?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=%23bf3989)](https://github.com/sponsors/yihui)
  has the following functions that optimize image files:
    -   `xfun::tinify()` is similar to `resmush_file()` but uses
        [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/). API key required.
    -   `xfun::optipng()` compress local files with OptiPNG (that needs to be
        installed locally).
-   [**optout**](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/optout) package by
    [\@coolbutuseless](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/). Similar to
    `xfun::optipng()` with additionall options. Needs additional software
    installed locally.
-   [Imgbot](https://imgbot.net/): Automatic optimization for files hosted in
    GitHub repos.
